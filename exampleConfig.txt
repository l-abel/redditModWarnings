notes = for variables 'id', 'refresh', 'secret', replace the assigned values following this guide here: https://www.reddit.com/comments/3cm1p8/how_to_make_your_bot_use_oauth2/
notes2 = current value for 'scopes' is all possible scopes. limit these if you are concerned about bot behavior or hijacking.
notes3 = uri is the value to use if you are running this from your own computer. probably needs to change if running from a hosted server.
